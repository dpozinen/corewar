# corewar
A reproduction of the Core War game. A project by a group of four. Original repository [here](http://github.com/ollevche/corewar)

The point of this project is to create a VM and a compiler for the players. <br>
Players are literal code that is compiled and placed on the map for execution by the vm. <br>
The vm executes any and all commands on the playing field keeping track of the player's carrets and field occupation. <br>
To win the player must occupy the most space in a given number of moves. <br>

An example of how the field looks during execution with two players <br> ![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/60f079047efa03ad0bc17b4dcf2099a0b8e0b398/687474703a2f2f672e7265636f726469742e636f2f593972394537384656592e676966)
